		<p> Hey, here's a bit about me. I went to undergrad at the Univeristy of Pittsburgh, where I studied communication. I chose Information Systems because I've always
		been fascinated by computers and the web. I don't know a lot about programming and such yet, but I'm very excited to learn! </p>
		
		<p> Outside of school I love to read, play video games, bake, watch movies, and play board games. I love nature and history as well. I have two birds, named Kiwi and Skye, 
		I have pictures of them in the "favorite pics" link above. </p> 
		
		<p> If you need to contact me, my school email is <a href="mailto:jdk356@drexel.edu">here</a>. </p>
