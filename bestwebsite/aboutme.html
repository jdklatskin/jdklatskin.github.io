<h1 align = "center"> This is a page telling you about my life. </h1>

<h3 align = "center"> What i like to do </h3>

<p> I am the creator of the best website in the world, and I would like to tell you, about me, I like eating food, skiing on Mt. Everrest, and swimming with the dolhins. The only music I listen to is a band called "The Greatist Band Ever" They are a mix of classic rock and chimpanzees screaming, it brings me to tears everytime I hear their wonderful music. </p>

<p> I also like to play sports. I am a professional ping pong player and am currently world champion. My last tournament was in Tokyo, and nobody could score a single point. Since I am so great, they no longer have ping pong competitions because they know I will always win.</p>

<p> Here is a partial list of all the pets I have, I love animals! </p>

<ol>
<li> 2 gorrilas </li>
<li> 3 snow leopards </li>
<li> A panda </li>
<li> A cloned velosorapter (my mom says if I get honor roll this year I can recreate Jurrassic Park on my private island. :D)b </li>
