<center><strong>Welcome to my brand new website!</strong> </center>

<p>Hey, I'm Jared, and this is a site I'm making for fun, and to show off what I do. As you can see there is not much here 
at the moment. I'll list my goals below (just my goals for this website, I could list my life goals
 or personal goals but I think they are outside the scope of this site). </p>

<ol>
<li> Make this site look nicer</li>
<li> Link to a blog. I thought about doing a Jeckyll blog on here but I think I'd rather just
    host the blog elsewhere for now. </li>
<li> Have my resume hosted on here, why not? </li>
<li> Link or host other web pages I want to make, or made in the past</li>
<li> Portfolio? Maybe, if I'm inspired to work on more personal projects </li>
<li> Other links? YouTube maybe, social medias (basically just use Instagram and sometimes Twitter)</li>
<li> Link to other sites I find interesting or compelling </li>
</ol>

<p>I think that's a good enough start. To tide you over, I'll host an old website here (Muffin Zone) that I made in
high school for a web development class. A few things to know about this site: 1. I got an A+ on it. 2. 
it originally had a midi file playing of "The Muffin Man" and this song had no off button, that was
intentional. It was meant to be annoying and humorous. Also, why muffins? I like muffins, I like baking,
and I think it's a good word. </p>
